Dollar notation is an implementation of an Expression Language, you use it to
make outputting dynamic values to you page easier, it can also be used for basic
conditional expressions.

It works with primitive values (that is ints, strings, etc), with classes and with
arrays.

A simple example of using Dollar Notation to keep your HTML clear of PHP script.

In your logic code, you add some attributes to the pagescope like this.

$this->setAttribute('user',  $user);          // $user is a Model class
$this->setAttribute('music_videos', $videos); // $videos is an array

Then in your HTML you can access these values like this

/** name equates to getName() on the model **/
<div class="loggedIn">${user.name}</div> 


/** loop around all the elements in the array and output the values.
    As you can see video must be a Model as we are accessing functions on it.
**/
<c:ForEach items="${music_videos}" var="video">
<tr id="row%video.id%"><td>%video.artist%</td><td>%video.song%</td></tr>
</c:ForEach>


There are also some basic maths rules and conditions that you can use.

e.g. 

<c:If test="${10 > 5}">
This will only be shown if 10 is greater than 5
</c:If>

and 

<c:Out value="${10 * 5}"/>
