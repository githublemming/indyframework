To create a Service you create a PHP interface file that extends ServiceInterface,
and that’s all there is too it. Here is an example of a Service definition

<?php
/**
 * Implementors of this Service must provide functionalty that provides in
 * some  shape or form the message ‘Hello World’
 */
interface HelloWorldService extends ServiceInterface
{
    /**
     * Returns a message.
     */
    public function sayHello();
}
?>


The above example is very simple, it defines a Service called HelloWordService 
that provides a single piece of functionality which is sayHello().
