Services
========

A Service defines functionality that is implemented by a Provider.

To create a Service you create a PHP interface file that extends ServiceInterface,
and that’s all there is too it. Here is an example of a Service definition

<?php
/**
 * Implementors of this Service must provide functionality that provides in
 * some shape or form the message ‘Hello World’
 */
interface HelloWorldService extends ServiceInterface
{
    /**
     * Returns a message.
     */
    public function sayHelloWorld();
}
?>


The above example is very simple, it defines a Service called HelloWordService 
that provides a single piece of functionality which is sayHelloWorld().

As you can see it extends ServiceInterface which is a marker interface that does 
not force any functionality. All Services must extend ServiceInterface, there is 
a check made during the loading of the application to ensure that all classes
being loaded as Providers implement this.
