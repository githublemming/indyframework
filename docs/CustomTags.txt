One of the really useful aspects of developing a website using Java was the ability
to create your own Custom Tags. These tags could used along side other standard
HTML tags in your page view. This served at least two functions 

1) it kept your markup code free
2) it provided the capability for whoever was responsible for writing the markup
   to add come logic into the page without resorting to Javascript.

Indy comes with a couple of tags already that are aimed at making life a bit easier
some of these are:

ForEach  : A loop mechanism just the thing for putting data on a page
If       : A condition tag
Import   : Acts as Required, loads the file into the position on the page
Out      : places a value in the page scope on the page
Remove   : removed a value from the page scope
Set      : sets a value on the page scope

Creating your own tag is fairly simple:

* you create a class
* extends either SimpleTag or BodyTag depending on your needs
* put your code in the doTag function.

Things to remember when creating tag, your code could be used on a variety of
platforms, some are case sensitive, some are case insensitive so you should follow
these naming conventions

* The class name should be the same as the file name with Tag appended on to it
  e.g ForEach.php  -> ForEachTag
* Your defintion should be the same as the file name and the class name e,g
    <tag>
        <name>ForEach</name>
    </tag>
