On of the really useful aspects of developing a website using Java was the ability
to create your own Custom Tags. These tags could used along side other standard
HTML tags in your page view. This served at least two functions

2) it provided the capability for whoever was responsible for writing the markup
   to add come logic into the page without resorting to Javascript
